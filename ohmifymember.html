                <h1>It's great to meet you!</h1>
                <p>If you’re the kind of person who wants to build electronic circuits and create working electronic
                    gadgets
                    then this might be just the place for you.</p>
                <p>If you want practical instruction that you can use straight away – as in, within minutes – then this
                    is
                    definitely the place for you!</p>
                <p>Ohmify is for people with little or no electronics understanding who want to be able to confidently

        <h3>your teacher</h3>
        <h2>I'm Oyvind - I created Ohmify!</h2>
        <img src="IMAGES/oyvind.png" alt="">
        <p>I fell in love with electronics when I was just 14.</p>
        <p>I wanted to create circuits, to make things that actually work.</p>
        <p>Learning from scratch was a struggle at first though. I had to gather learning resources from so many
            different places.
        </p>
        <p>And so many of them went into way too much detail about components, circuits, concepts – using all sorts of
            complex words and ideas. I just wanted to make things!
        </p>
        <p><strong>But I loved creating working gadgets.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>So I kept with it. I loved the feeling of designing a circuit, selecting the components, putting it together,
            and then finding that it actually worked.
        </p>
        <p>My schoolboy passion for electronics got me to Oslo University – and that turned into a Master’s Degree in
            Electronics.
        </p>
        <p>I’m a published author now – and have been involved in some pretty heavyweight industrial electronics
            projects – but I have never lost sight of the fact that, at its heart, practical electronics is
            straightforward, uncomplicated, and great fun to learn.
        </p>
        <p>I still love building things and I really do love helping people find out just how much fun all this is!
        </p>
        <p>So I created Ohmify for people who really just want to get on with creating electronics.
        </p>
        <h3>ABOUT OHMIFY</h3>
        <h2>So What Exactly Is Ohmify?</h2>
        <p>Imagine being in a position where electronics holds no mystery, where you can confidently combine components,
            build your own circuits and create actual working projects.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine too that you can talk confidently about how circuits work, you can solve all manner of electronics
            problems and, if you wish, you can design, plan and create your own more challenging projects.
        </p>
        <p>Sounds good?</p>

        <p>Well, members of Ohmify don’t have to imagine this because, for them, this is their reality.
            <br>How come?
        </p>
        <p>Because while dry, theoretical book-learning is enjoyable for a few people what we’ve seen over and over
            again is that hands-on practical learning where you learn by doing is enjoyable for everyone.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Ohmify helps you learn by doing</strong></p>
        <p>Of course, our members want to understand electronics theory and principles too – but they want to learn them
            by doing electronics, not sat up all night with a pile of books, drowning in mathematics.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Your learning, your way</strong></p>
        <p>Ohmify is a comprehensive but fun online electronics course that lets you learn at your own pace, in your own
            time, with no schedule and no exams.
        </p>
        <p>And should you ever get stuck – ask! There’s lots of talent and knowledge at Ohmify and we’re all here to
            help you move forward.

        <h1>It’s More Than Just Teaching</h1>
        <p>Ohmify teaches – but we go beyond just teaching.</p>
        <p>Ohmify is a community of people – people just like you.</p>
        <p>We all have the same thing in common – a love of electronics – and all your fellow community members are
            learners, just like you.
        </p>
        <h3>And we’re all at different stages</h3>
        <p>Some of us started learning months ago. Some will be starting today.</p>
        <p>Ohmify has grown into a family of people who try things out, share their successes, discuss any challenges,
            swap ideas, offer help, ask questions, get interested in each other’s projects….
        </p>
        <h3>Do it your way</h3>
        <p>Of course, you can choose to get involved or just quietly get on with things at your own pace in your own
            way. It’s completely up to you.
        </p>
        <p>And I’m always there to offer advice, insight, and ideas whether you’re working with transistors or
            cutting-edge electronics.
        </p>
        <h2>SUCCESS FORMULA</h2>
        <h1> Does Ohmify Work So Well?</h1>
        <p> Getting Ohmify so that it works this well didn’t happen overnight. But through a process of continual
            improvement – and great feedback from members – we can say this about our club:
        </p>
        <h3>✔ It’s Complete</h3>
        <p>What’s unique about Ohmify is that it brings years of technical expertise and distills it into a structured
            but highly practical electronics learning site.
        </p>
        <p>Everything you need is here so no need to go hunting around the internet, posting in forums, watching endless
            videos, and generally getting frustrated as you try to tie up loose ends.
        </p>
        <p>Just log in and start producing results!
        </p>
        <h3>✔ It’s Expert</h3>
        <p>Not only are the projects designed by someone with a master in electronics (that’ll be me, Oyvind, by the
            way!) but I’m on hand to answer queries, offer suggestions, give advice, and generally make your learning
            not only effective but satisfying and fun.
        </p>
        <h3>✔ It’s Time Efficient</h3>
        <p>Not everyone has hours at a time to learn and play with electronics. So the projects are broken into small
            steps meaning you can do as much as you have time for. Later, you can pick up where you left off.
        </p>
        <h3>✔ It’s A Community</h3>
        <p>I’m not the only one who will help you out. Our community is close-knit and very helpful. Post a query and
            you’ll get answers!

        <p>So here we are: you want to build electronics projects, enjoy the satisfaction of understanding how it all
            works, and have all the fun of building working gadgets.
        </p>
        <p>You’re keen to get results, eager to understand how things work, and excited about being able to confidently
            work with components, wires, and circuit boards.
        </p>
        <h3>Here’s the good news:</h3>

        <p>Ohmify has helped hundreds of people like you do exactly that.</p>

        <p>They’re learning quickly, creating their own gadgets, and really enjoying the results.</p>

        <p>And if you sign up today we have a special bonus offer for you.
        </p>
        <p>Because there’s one thing that people often wonder about when starting to learn electronics:
        </p>
        <h3>Where will I get the components for the various projects?
        </h3>
        <p>Actually, they’re not at all difficult to obtain – electrical shops everywhere sell the kinds of components
            you will need.
        </p>
        <p>And then mail-order firms offer low prices and quick delivery. It’s very easy.
        </p>
        <h3>But because you’ll be eager to start – and because, as a relative beginner you won’t know what components
            you’ll need in the early days – I’m going to make life even simpler for you.
        </h3>
        <p>Sign up for our monthly membership and I’ll gather together all the components you need for the projects in
            the foundational Learn Electronics course in our program.
        </p>
        <p>And you can have them at a heavily discounted price.
        </p>
        <h3>As soon as they arrive at your house you can start building!</h3>

        <p>While you’re waiting just sit back and watch the initial material – let the ideas soak in.
        </p>
        <p>If you decide to go for our popular discounted yearly plan then we’ll send you the components free of charge.
        </p>
        <p>Either way – this valuable bonus makes things very easy for you.</p>

                    <p>No, we don’t force you into any long-term contracts. Our best price is available as an
                        annual subscription, but we offer monthly subscriptions as well. Just cancel before the
                        next renewal if you don’t want to continue.</p>
