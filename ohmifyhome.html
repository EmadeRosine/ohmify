            <h1>Hey there!</h1>
           <p> I’m Oyvind, the creator of Ohmify. </p>

            <p>My interest in electronic circuits started when I was around 14 years old. One day I started thinking about how you could make a light blink.</p>
            
           <p>I got more and more curious until I just had to figure it out. In such a situation it was good to have a father with electronics experience.</p>
            
           <p>But that single incident was the start of a life-long love affair with all things electronic.</p>
            
            <p>Since then I’ve received my Master’s degree in electronics and computer science and I’ve done a lot of professional electronics development.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the projects I’ve been involved with:</p>
        </p>
        <a href="#">The RØST Coffee Roaster</a><br>
        <a href="#">The Manga Screen</a><br>
        <a href="#">The D1 See-through-wall Sensor</a>
    </div>
        <div class="aboutfirst-part1">
        <p>
            But there’s one thing I’ve noticed: the language used in most electronics books is hard to understand if you don’t already know electronics. I want to change that. <br> <br>
            I’ve created several books on electronics for beginners – and I’ve written them in language that makes sense to people who are new to the subject. Take a look at <a href="#"> Electronics For Kids</a> and <a href="#">A Beginner’s Guide To Circuits.</a><br><br>
            Of course, life isn’t all about electronics! I’m born and bred in Norway but since 2013 I’ve been traveling and living all over the world: Mexico, New York, Miami, Colombia, Berlin, Sydney, Sweden, +++ <br><br>
            And in 2017 I married the woman of my dreams. Together we travel, do workshops, go on adventures and create courses. <br><br>
            I’m passionate about teaching electronics in the simplest and most accessible way possible. So if you want to learn electronics in a new and fun way – you’re invited to join me on the inside:
