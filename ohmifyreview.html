       <div class="review1"> <p> <span>"</span>Thank you, Oyvind, for creating such cool educational websites/forums/books/etc.! Ohmify appears to be much better suited for strictly electronic makers, and specifically the FUTURE makers of the world. <i>David Weissman, United States</i></p></div>
        <div class="review2"><p><span>"</span> Ohmify cuts to the essence and is helping me jump into making things much faster. It‚Äôs the right medicine at the right time in my journey, and you can quote me. <i> Mike Kimbriel, United States</i></p></div>
       <div class="review3"> <p><span>"</span> Ohmify is a very good platform to learn electronics, with lots of sample projects. I wish I could have come across this when I was in high school. <i> Sandhya Mudunuru, United States</i></p></div>
       <div class="review4"> <p><span>"</span> I have to say that your site and your courses are perfect for me, almost as if you wrote them specifically for me. <i>Doug Roberson, United States</i></p></div>

        <h1>Independent Ohmify Reviews</h1>
        <p>I understand that reviews get more weight when they‚Äôre found off-site. So if you prefer, you can also find independent Ohmify reviews that members have left on <a href="#">Trustpilot</a> and on our Ohmify business page on Google. Just <a href="#">search for ‚ÄòOhmify‚Äô on Google</a> and click on the reviews link next to the stars in the business profile box that should appear in the result.</p>
        <p>If you know about other review sources, please let us know.</p>
